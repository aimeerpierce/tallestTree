# Tallest Tree Clicker Game
Tallest Tree is a clicker game inspired by a [radiolab podcast](http://www.radiolab.org/story/from-tree-to-shining-tree/) about how trees communicate with each other.

## Developed with:  
Node / Express  
MongoDB / Mongoose  
HTML / CSS  
AngularJS  

## Why did I make this?
I made this game for a school project where we were tasked to make a web application.
I wanted to experiment with the **MEAN** (**M**ongoDB **E**xpress **A**ngular **N**ode) platform to get experience with Node and MongoDB specifically.
This was the first project that I actually stored user data - I used mlab's sandbox which made it really easy. 
I also wanted to try out using multiple Angular controllers like a full-scale app would, and ended up using a shared-variables module which created some scope frustrations, but was an interesting exercise at the least.
